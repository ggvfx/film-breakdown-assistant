Three others cluster around a \n       battery of humming ULTRACENTRIFUGES. The sixth enters \n       data into a wall-mounted glass interface.\n\n\n       Dominating the center of the room is a massive industrial \n       CRANE. Its hydraulic arm suspends a lead-lined containment \n       unit over a REACTION CHAMBER.\n\n\n       Other props clutter the space: \n       - ELECTRON MICROSCOPES \n       - LIQUID NITROGEN DEWARS (venting cold vapor)\n       - SPECTROMETERS\n       - OSCILLOSCOPES flickering with green waves\n       - VIAL RACKS\n       - BEXTER FLASKS\n       - PETRI DISHES\n       - INCUBATORS\n       - PIPETTES\n       - HAZMAT KITS\n       - GEL ELECTROPHORESIS TANKS.\n\n\n       STUNT SEQUENCE:\n\n\n       Suddenly, a pressure seal on the containment unit \n       FAILURE-HISSES. A thick plume of acrid SMOKE errupts.\n\n\n       TWO STUNT GUARDS in tactical gear rush the platform. \n\n\n       GUARD 1 slides under the swinging arm of the CRANE as \n       the internal alarms scream. \n\n\n       GUARD 2 is thrown back by a concussive burst of pressure, \n       performing a full-body flip onto a stack of equipment \n       crates. \n\n\n       The Scientists dive for cover behind the centrifuges as \n       the crane begins to buckle under a strange, violet \n       gravitational pull.\n\n\n                               DR. ARIS\n                 Don't let the containment drop! If \n                 that seal breaks, the city is gone!\n\n\n       The crane groans. The smoke thickens, turning a deep, \n       unnatural purple.\n\n\n                                               FADE OUT.",
