1      INT. RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT                               1


       The lab is a sprawling cathedral of glass and steel. 
       A pervasive CHEMICAL SMELL—sharp, like ionized sulfur—
       hangs in the air. 


       SIX SCIENTISTS (Background) move with clinical urgency. 
       Two monitor a row of shimmering BEAKERS filled with 
       luminescent sludge. Three others cluster around a 
       battery of humming ULTRACENTRIFUGES. The sixth enters 
       data into a wall-mounted glass interface.


       Dominating the center of the room is a massive industrial 
       CRANE. Its hydraulic arm suspends a lead-lined containment 
       unit over a REACTION CHAMBER.


       Other props clutter the space: 
       - ELECTRON MICROSCOPES 
       - LIQUID NITROGEN DEWARS (venting cold vapor)
       - SPECTROMETERS
       - OSCILLOSCOPES flickering with green waves
       - VIAL RACKS
       - BEXTER FLASKS
       - PETRI DISHES
       - INCUBATORS
       - PIPETTES
       - HAZMAT KITS
       - GEL ELECTROPHORESIS TANKS.


       STUNT SEQUENCE:


       Suddenly, a pressure seal on the containment unit 
       FAILURE-HISSES. A thick plume of acrid SMOKE errupts.


       TWO STUNT GUARDS in tactical gear rush the platform. 


       GUARD 1 slides under the swinging arm of the CRANE as 
       the internal alarms scream. 


       GUARD 2 is thrown back by a concussive burst of pressure, 
       performing a full-body flip onto a stack of equipment 
       crates. 


       The Scientists dive for cover behind the centrifuges as 
       the crane begins to buckle under a strange, violet 
       gravitational pull.


                               DR. ARIS
                 Don't let the containment drop! If 
                 that seal breaks, the city is gone!


       The crane groans. The smoke thickens, turning a deep, 
       unnatural purple.


                                               FADE OUT.
